/**
 * @file ThinkGear.java
 * 
 * The ThinkGear Communications Driver (TGCD) is a set of library functions
 * which allows applications to communicate with ThinkGear modules.  The
 * TGCD functions are implemented as a shared library (.dll on Windows,
 * .bundle on Mac OS X).
 * <p>
 * This ThinkGear class for Java is simply a thin interface layer which uses 
 * Java Native Interface to provide access to the API functions in the TGCD
 * library, allowing Java programs to use the TGCD to communicate with
 * ThinkGear modules.
 * <p>
 * Because the class is merely a thin interface to the underlying shared
 * TGCD library, it is entirely dependent on the underlying TGCD library
 * to function, and is therefore only supported on platforms which can
 * run the TGCD itself (i.e. Windows and Mac OS X platforms).
 * <p>
 * There are three "tiers" of functions in this API, where functions
 * of a lower "tier" should not be called until an appropriate function
 * in the "tier" above it is called first:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * Tier 1:  Call anytime
 *     GetDriverVersion()
 *     GetNewConnectionId()
 *
 * Tier 2:  Requires GetNewConnectionId()
 *     SetStreamLog()
 *     SetDataLog()
 *     Connect()
 *     FreeConnection()
 *
 * Tier 3:  Requires Connect()
 *     ReadPackets()
 *     GetValue()
 *     SendByte()
 *     SetBaudrate()
 *     SetDataFormat()
 *     Disconnect()
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * The contents of this file are generated from thinkgear.h, with the following
 * text manipulations:
 *   - "#define TG_"   => "public static final int "
 *   - "x ///<"        => "= x; ///<"
 *   - "THINKGEAR_API" => "public static native " 
 *   - "const char *"  => "String "
 *   - "float"         => "double"
 *   - "TG_"           => ""
 *   - "@c x"          => "{@code x}"

	/**
	 * Enables or disables background auto-reading of the connection.  This

	 *  - Setting @c enabled to anything other than 0 will enable background
	 *    auto-reading on the specified connection.  Setting @c enabled to 0
	 *    will disable it.
	 *  - Enabling causes a background thread to be spawned for the connection
	 *    (only if one was not already previously spawned), which continuously
	 *    calls TG_ReadPacket( connectionId, -1 ) at 1ms intervals.
	 *  - Disabling will kill the background thread for the connection.
	 *  - While background auto-reading is enabled, the calling program can use
	 *    TG_GetValue() at any time to get the most-recently-received value of
	 *    any data type. The calling program will have no way of knowing when
	 *    a value has been updated.  For most data types other than raw wave
	 *    value, this is not much of a problem if the program simply polls
	 *    TG_GetValue() once a second or so.
	 *  - The current implementation of this function will not include proper
	 *    data synchronization. This means it is possible for a value to be
	 *    read (by TG_GetValue()) at the same time it is being written to by
	 *    the background thread, resulting in a corrupted value being read.
	 *    However, this is extremely unlikely for most data types other than
	 *    raw wave value.
